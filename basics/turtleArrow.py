# Step 1: Make all the "turtle" commands available to us.
import turtle
from turtle import *

# help(turtle)
# Step 2: Create a new turtle. We'll call it "bob"
# bob = turtle.Turtle()

# Step 3: Move in the direction Bob's facing for 50 pixels
# import.forward(50)
forward(50)
# Step 4: Move in the direction Bob's turns for 90 degrees
left(90)
forward(50)

# Step 4: We're done!
# turtle.done()
